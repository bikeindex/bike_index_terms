About our terms of service for vendors
======================================

**Welcome to the Bike Index**. We developed a publicly-accessible bike registration service (the "Service") that gives you the ability to quickly and easily register bikes for your customers, because we believe that such a service will deter bike theft.

By putting bike shop employees and proprietors (the "Vendors") in charge of adding bikes to the service we aim to involve biking communities, support bike shops, and ensure accurate registrations. We have tried to draft this Terms of Service For Vendors to be as simple and comprehensible as possible. Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make it a very difficult task. So, should you have any questions or concerns or simply want to better understand how we do things at the Bike Index, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://www.bikeindex.org/contact_us).

Below is a quick description of the sections in this Agreement where we attempt to explain the important parts of our service, but there are important details in the whole document, so you should read it.

### Bike Index Vendor Service

We provide you with a service to register the bikes you interact with; we will respect and protect your and your customers' privacy, data and personal information. You run your business, service your customers, report & pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations.

### Becoming a Vendor on the Bike Index

Because the Bike Index relies on partnering with bike retailers, we may need to verify your status as a bike retailer. You provide us with basic information about your business; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by us or our friends). You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or we otherwise must decline to offer you the service.

### Charges for the Service

There is no initial fee, you only pay for the bikes you register on our service. You are billed on a monthly schedule (the "Billing period") for each bike you registered during that billing period. You can choose to fulfill this obligation through automatic billing or by manually entering payment details for each bill. The Bike Index exclusively accepts vendor payments through our online interface.

### Termination and Other Legal Terms

We can deactivate your ability to register new bikes or terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you do something bad). You can also terminate anytime. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment).

### Bike Index Vendor Terms of Service

The Terms and Conditions described here constitute a legal agreement ("Agreement") between the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the "Vendor" on the Service registration page (sometimes referred to as "you," "your", "merchant"), and Bike Index, Inc. ("Bike Index").

Section A: The Bike Index Service
---------------------------------

### 1. Our Role

Our Service helps you quickly and easily register bikes for your customers, and give customers the ability to modify most aspects of their registrations. You will be required to register with Bike Index to use the Bike Index Vendor Service (see Becoming a Bike Index Vendor). In addition, we do not assume any liability for bicycles, tricycles or other types of crafts (collectively "Bikes") registered through our Service.

### 2. Payment Terms.

Customers pay you &#36;9.00 for every bike you register through our service. On a monthly schedule the Bike Index will bill you &#36;4.00 for each bike you registered in that billing period.

Payment to the Bike Index is required within 14 days of the end of your billing period, or by the due date of the invoice we send to you (whichever date is later). If any amount of the bill remains unpaid after this due date, Bike Index will deactivate your ability to register new bikes until the remaining payments are made.

Additionally, at any point, you may elect to pay for all of the bikes that you have registered and not yet paid for. Your next billing period will begin immediately after you make this payment.

You are responsible for payment for all bikes registered through your use of the service. If unauthorized use of our service has been made, you are required to report the usage before the end of the billing period during which the usage occurred.

### 3. Customer Service

We will provide you with customer service to resolve any issues relating to your Bike Index account, the registration of bikes through our service, and use of our software, and the distribution of funds to pay for your use of our service. You, and you alone, are responsible for any and all issues related to charging your customers for the registration of bikes with our service, including but not limited to correctly charging the agreed upon fee for their registration.

### 4. Security

Bike Index is responsible for protecting the security of user data in our possession and will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in our servers from unauthorized access and accidental loss or modification. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide this personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk. We recommend you review our [Privacy Policy](https://bikeindex.org/privacy), which will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us.

### 5. Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of our service to your customers and the payments you receive in connection with your use of the service ("Taxes"). It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the proper tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process and merchants to which we provide card payment services.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, merchant acquiring entities and third party settlement organizations are required to file an information return with the IRS for each calendar year, reporting all payment card transactions and third party network transactions with merchants occurring in that calendar year. You acknowledge that we will report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of the payments you receive each calendar year as required by law.

### 6. Your Privacy

If you receive information about others, including Bike Index Users, through the use of the Service, you must keep such information confidential and only use it in connection with the Service. You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a third party or use any such information for marketing purposes unless you receive the express consent of the user to do so.

### 8. Restricted Use
